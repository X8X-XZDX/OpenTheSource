##### Feel Free to write about any problems that bug you in TF2, make your points concise and _sharp_.

## Lag Compensation & Inconsistent Hitreg
- Lag Compensation and the client not being up-to-date really makes playing against spy/sniper (or soldier's Market Gardener) OR playing as them more annoying. It doesn't have to be perfect as there always will be edge cases.. but it really needs to be refined.

## Spy
- Diguises have been broken for... a long while now and they should obviously be fixed. 
- This may the result of inexperience.. but the range of a backstab sometimes isn't clear when you go in for the kill. 

## Main Menu
- It feels overwhelming for new players and clutters up all your screen and it isn't clear what is what and is just kind of all over the place feeling like it's held by duct tape.
- Obviously, tf2 huds exist that will modify it but you DON'T have to do that. The main menu should do it's job well in not scaring away new players (I myself was confused when I started playing)

## Tutorial
- It's pretty well known that the tutorial is far worse than just being lack-luster. It does a terrible job at introducing new players to the world of TF2.
- The main problems are that it does NOT cover all classes and does NOT cover the base mechanics for every mercenary (like rocket jumping)
- It also should give a litte bit more insight into alternate loadouts/weapons/gamemodes/roles of a mercenary (you obviously cannot explain each and every thing.. but it needs something that points to other seemingly hidden game mechanics and give atleast a short introduction)
